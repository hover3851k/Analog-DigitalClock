Analog Digital Clock Java Application

Overview

This Java application displays a graphical analog and digital clock. The clock features a dynamic gradient background that changes every second, adding a visually appealing effect. The analog clock hands are drawn using Java's Graphics2D API, while the digital clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
